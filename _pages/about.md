I recently graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara and earned a BA degree in Linguistics (Language and Speech Technologies Emphasis) and in Communication. I'm especially passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and/or computational linguistics. 

#### Hobbies and Interests
I've always been very interested in learning new languages. I chose to minor in Japanese when I was studying at UCSB, and one hour of chatting and reading in Japanese was really the best way to start my day as a college student. Recently, I've been thinking about learning Italian but I haven't really started on anything.

Travelling is also something I enjoy a lot, but I haven't been travelling as much since the COVID-19 pandemic. Travelling calms me down by allowing me to temporarily escape from reality and just reflect on things quietly. I've been to amazing places like Chengdu, Tokyo, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Koh Samui, New York and many more. In the next few years, I'd like to discover more hidden places on earth, like Machu Picchu.

I usually spend my leisure time playing video games. Recently, my favorite games are [NARAKA](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203220/NARAKA_BLADEPOINT/) and It Takes Two. I'm also a big fan of sim racing games, my favorite of which is Assetto Corsa Competizione.
