I'm a full-time Master's student studying [computational linguistics](https://www.compling.uw.edu/) at University of Washington. I'm especially passionate about applications of NLP and ML to interdisciplinary research and solving real-world problems.

### Research

##### Stigma related to substance use in social media posts

Employing NLP methodology to uncover the implicit patterns of stigma/stigmatizing behaviors in social media posts.

##### Inductive Biases of LSTM and Transformer Language Models

Using a filtered corpus approach to analyze LSTM and Transformer language models' performance and the extent to which these models have human-like linguistic biases.

##### Social Identification and Interpersonal Communication in Zoom Virtual Groups

This is an independent research study I conducted independent research under the supervision of UCSB Department of Communication's [Senior Honors Program](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/undergrad/senior-honors). My thesis was titled "Social Identification and Interpersonal Communication in Zoom Virtual Groups." Guided by [Dr. Joe Walther](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther), [Dr. Jennifer Gibbs](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/jennifer-gibbs), and [Dr. Gordon Abra](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/gordon-abra), I conducted an online experiment to study interpersonal and intergroup dynamics in college students during remote instruction. I was nominated for the [Luis Leal Social Sciences Undergraduate Award](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/topics/luis-leal-award) for my research contribution.

### Experiences
From March to June 2021, I worked as a NLP intern as a part of [Rezonator](https://rezonator.com/) app development team. I developed a conversation parser to parse conversation transcripts in Chinese into smaller speech units like intonation units (IUs) and conducted language data pre-processing using Python and relevant libraries (e.g. SpaCy).

I spent my senior year at UCSB working as the Media Manager at [Center for Information Technology and Society (CITS)](https://cits.ucsb.edu/), where I maintained the center's website, managed the center's social media presence, developed and designed promotional materials for academic events, and maintained the center's database which stores publications of the center's affiliates.
