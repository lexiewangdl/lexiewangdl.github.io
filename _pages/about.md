I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2021, and earned a BA degree in Linguistics (Language and Speech Technologies Emphasis) and in Communication. I'm especially passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) / computational linguistics.  Starting September 2022, I will be studying Computational Linguistics at University of Washington.

#### Research
My main research interests include natural language understanding, generative AI, machine translation, semantic analysis, and interdisciplinary research using NLP techniques for social scientific research.

I conducted independent research under the supervision of UCSB Department of Communication's [Senior Honors Program](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/undergrad/senior-honors). My thesis was titled "Social Identification and Interpersonal Communication in Zoom Virtual Groups." Guided by [Dr. Joe Walther](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther), [Dr. Jennifer Gibbs](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/jennifer-gibbs), and [Dr. Gordon Abra](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/gordon-abra), I conducted an online experiment to study interpersonal and intergroup dynamics in college students during remote instruction. I was nominated for the [Luis Leal Social Sciences Undergraduate Award](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/topics/luis-leal-award) for my research contribution.

#### Experiences
From March to June 2021, I worked as a NLP intern as a part of [Rezonator](https://rezonator.com/) app development team. I developed a conversation parser to parse conversation transcripts in Chinese into smaller speech units like intonation units (IUs) and conducted language data pre-processing using Python and relevant libraries (e.g. SpaCy).

I spent my senior year at UCSB working as the Media Manager at [Center for Information Technology and Society (CITS)](https://cits.ucsb.edu/), where I managed the center's online presence (website and twitter), developed promotional materials for academic events, and organized publications of the center's affiliates. 

I've also volunteered at UCSB's [Orfalea Family Children Center](https://childrenscenter.sa.ucsb.edu/programs-curriculum/ofcc), where I transcribed children's books into International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and translated works originally written in English into Chinese and Pinyin.
#### Hobbies and Interests
I've always been a zealous language learner. I speak four languages: Mandarin, English, Japanese, and Italian. 
I chose to minor in Japanese when I was in college. I hold the N2-level certificate of [Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/) 
I can also speak elementary Italian.

I also enjoy a variety of sports including snowboarding, tennis, weightlifting, etc. I'm also a motorcycle rider.
