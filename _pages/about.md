I'm a full-time Master's student studying [computational linguistics](https://www.compling.uw.edu/) at University of Washington. 
I'm especially passionate about applications of NLP and ML to interdisciplinary research and solving real-world problems.

## Research

### Stigma related to substance use in social media posts

Employing NLP methodology to uncover the implicit patterns of stigma/stigmatizing behaviors in social media posts.

### Inductive Biases of LSTM and Transformer Language Models

Using a filtered corpus approach to analyze LSTM and Transformer language models' performance and the extent to which these models have human-like linguistic biases.

### Social Identification and Interpersonal Communication in Zoom Virtual Groups

This is an independent research study I conducted independent research under the supervision of UCSB Department of Communication's [Senior Honors Program](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/undergrad/senior-honors). 
My thesis was titled "Social Identification and Interpersonal Communication in Zoom Virtual Groups." 
Guided by [Dr. Joe Walther](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther), [Dr. Jennifer Gibbs](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/jennifer-gibbs), and [Dr. Gordon Abra](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/gordon-abra), 
I conducted an online experiment to study interpersonal and intergroup dynamics in college students during remote instruction. 
I was nominated for the [Luis Leal Social Sciences Undergraduate Award](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/topics/luis-leal-award) for my research contribution.

## Projects

### STM: SenTiMetalchemy: Multi-modal Approach to Sentiment Analysis
This is a final project for [LING 573: Natural Language Processing Systems and Applications](https://linguistics.washington.edu/courses/2020/spring/ling/573/a).
We designed and developed a multi-modal sentiment analysis system that takes in textual, acoustic, and visual features and outputs a sentiment and an emotion label.
Our model architecture utilizes LSTM layers, attention mechanism, and fully connected layers.

### Language Identification (LangID)

### HPSG-based Parsing and Machine Translation System for Hixkaryana
This is the course project for [LING 567: Knowledge Engineering for NLP](https://linguistics.washington.edu/courses/2020/spring/ling/567/a).
Instructed by [Dr. Emily Bender](https://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/), we developed a parser and machine translation system for Hixkaryana, a language spoken by approximately 500 people in Brazil.
This system is based on Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) and implemented using DELPH-IN, LinGO Grammar Matrix, and Lexical Knowledge Builder (LKB).
My partner and I hand-crafted hixkaryana lexicon, lexical rules, and transfer rules to handle various grammatical phenomena (argument optionality, agreement, case, wh questions, etc.) based on data provided by field linguists.
Through this project, I learned about the challenges of developing a grammar for a language that is under-documented and under-resourced.
This project is especially meaningful to me because I had the opportunity to employ my linguistic knowledge and computational skills to help preserve a language that is on the verge of extinction.

## Experiences

From March to June 2021, I worked as a NLP intern as a part of [Rezonator](https://rezonator.com/) app development team. I developed a conversation parser to parse conversation transcripts in Chinese into smaller speech units like intonation units (IUs) and conducted language data pre-processing using Python and relevant libraries (e.g. SpaCy).

I spent my senior year at UCSB working as the Media Manager at [Center for Information Technology and Society (CITS)](https://cits.ucsb.edu/), where I maintained the center's website, managed the center's social media presence, developed and designed promotional materials for academic events, and maintained the center's database which stores publications of the center's affiliates.
