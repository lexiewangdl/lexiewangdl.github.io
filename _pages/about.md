I recently graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara and earned a BA degree in Linguistics (Language and Speech Technologies Emphasis) and in Communication. I'm especially passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) / computational linguistics. As of right now, I'm in the process of applying for a graduate program in NLP/CL.

#### Research
My main research interests include machine translation, semantic analysis, and interdisciplinary research using NLP techniques to study social scientific issues.

I conducted independent research under the supervision of UCSB Department of Communication's [Senior Honors Program](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/undergrad/senior-honors). My thesis was titled "Social Identification and Interpersonal Communication in Zoom Virtual Groups." Guided by [Dr. Joe Walther](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther), [Dr. Jennifer Gibbs](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/jennifer-gibbs), and [Dr. Gordon Abra](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/gordon-abra), I conducted an online experiment to study interpersonal and intergroup dynamics in college students during remote instruction. I was nominated for the [Luis Leal Social Sciences Undergraduate Award](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/topics/luis-leal-award) for my research contribution.

I hope to conduct more research in NLP-related fields in the future!
#### Experiences
From March to June 2021, I worked as a NLP intern as a part of [Rezonator](https://rezonator.com/) app development team. I developed a conversation parser to parse conversation transcripts in Chinese into smaller speech units like intonation units (IUs). I also used spaCy to pre-process language data.

I spent my senior year at UCSB working as the Media Manager at [Center for Information Technology and Society (CITS)](https://cits.ucsb.edu/), where I managed the center's online presence (website and twitter), developed promotional materials for academic events, and organized publications of the center's affiliates. 

I've also volunteered at UCSB's [Orfalea Family Children Center](https://childrenscenter.sa.ucsb.edu/programs-curriculum/ofcc), where I transcribed children's books into International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and translated works originally written in English into Chinese and Pinyin.
#### Hobbies and Interests
I've always been very interested in learning new languages. I chose to minor in Japanese when I was studying at UCSB, and one hour of chatting and reading in Japanese was really the best way to start my day as a college student. I hold the N2-level certificate of [Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/) Recently, I've been thinking about learning Italian but I haven't really started on anything.

Travelling is also something I enjoy a lot, but I haven't been travelling as much since the COVID-19 pandemic. Travelling calms me down by allowing me to temporarily escape from reality and just reflect on things quietly. I've been to amazing places like Chengdu, Tokyo, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Koh Samui, New York and many more. In the next few years, I'd like to discover more hidden places on earth, like Machu Picchu.

I usually spend my leisure time playing video games. Recently, my favorite games are [NARAKA](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203220/NARAKA_BLADEPOINT/) and It Takes Two. I'm also a big fan of sim racing games, my favorite of which is Assetto Corsa Competizione.
