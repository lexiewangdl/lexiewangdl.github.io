I'm a full-time Master's student studying [computational linguistics](https://www.compling.uw.edu/) at University of Washington. I'm especially passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP) / computational linguistics. My main research interests include machine translation, semantic analysis, and interdisciplinary research using NLP techniques to study social scientific issues. I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2021, and earned a BA degree in Linguistics (Language and Speech Technologies Emphasis) and in Communication.  

#### Research

##### Stigma related to substance use in social media posts

Employing NLP methodology to uncover the implicit patterns of stigma/stigmatizing behaviors in social media posts.

##### Inductive Biases of LSTM and Transformer Language Models

Using a filtered corpus approach to analyze LSTM and Transformer language models' performance and the extent to which these models have human-like linguistic biases.

##### Social Identification and Interpersonal Communication in Zoom Virtual Groups

This is an independent research study I conducted independent research under the supervision of UCSB Department of Communication's [Senior Honors Program](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/undergrad/senior-honors). My thesis was titled "Social Identification and Interpersonal Communication in Zoom Virtual Groups." Guided by [Dr. Joe Walther](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther), [Dr. Jennifer Gibbs](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/jennifer-gibbs), and [Dr. Gordon Abra](https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/gordon-abra), I conducted an online experiment to study interpersonal and intergroup dynamics in college students during remote instruction. I was nominated for the [Luis Leal Social Sciences Undergraduate Award](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/topics/luis-leal-award) for my research contribution.

#### Experiences
From March to June 2021, I worked as a NLP intern as a part of [Rezonator](https://rezonator.com/) app development team. I developed a conversation parser to parse conversation transcripts in Chinese into smaller speech units like intonation units (IUs) and conducted language data pre-processing using Python and relevant libraries (e.g. SpaCy).

I spent my senior year at UCSB working as the Media Manager at [Center for Information Technology and Society (CITS)](https://cits.ucsb.edu/), where I maintained the center's website, managed the center's social media presence, developed and designed promotional materials for academic events, and maintained the center's database which stores publications of the center's affiliates. 

#### Hobbies and Interests
##### Language Learning

As a computational linguist who received training as a linguist, I've always been a zealous language learner. I minored in Japanese in college. I hold the N2-level certificate of [Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/) Recently, I started learning Italian. Mi chiamo Lexie, e sono cinese di Dalian.

##### Travelling

Travelling is also something I enjoy a lot, as it calms me down by allowing me to temporarily escape from reality and just reflect on things quietly. I've been to exciting places like Chengdu, Tokyo, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Koh Samui, and many more. 

##### Sports

I enjoy a variety of sports including snowboarding (my recent favorite), weightlifting, surfing, tennis, etc. Plus, I'm a video gamer and simulation racer.
